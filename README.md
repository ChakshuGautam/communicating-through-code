# Communicating Through Code

This repo contains the code used in my presentation for `Communication Through Code` 

## calculate_weighted_sum

This function takes three numerical inputs and calculates their weighted sum, with weights of 2, 3, and 5 respectively. It's useful for scenarios where you need to calculate a weighted average or similar metrics.

Test the code by running `pytest` in the terminal.
